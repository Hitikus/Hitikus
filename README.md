### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm currently completing my fifth year of studies at the University of Split – FESB.  
Over the course of my education, I’ve developed a strong interest in:

- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence  
- 🔒 Cybersecurity  
- 🎮 Game Development  
- 🛠️ Backend Technologies

While I haven’t had a formal internship yet, I’ve worked on **several hands-on projects** that helped me build practical experience in:

- ✅ Git & GitHub
- ✅ C, C++, C#
- ✅ REST APIs with Postman
- ✅ Problem-solving & team collaboration

I’m eager to learn, quick to adapt, and excited about the opportunity to grow within a professional software team.
